## Building the Project&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2em">🛠️</span>

To get started, follow these quick steps:

1. Make sure you have _Node.js_ and _npm_ installed on your system.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run:
    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```
    This command generates the Tailwind CSS output based on your project's setup.

    Alternatively, for automatic updates as you work, run:
    ```shell
    npm run watch
    ```
    This keeps an eye on your files, rebuilding the Tailwind CSS whenever you make changes.
    > **LPT:** Install the 'Live Server' VS Code extension for automatic page reloading and seamless updates as you code.

Happy coding! <span style="font-size: 1.2em">🤓</span>
